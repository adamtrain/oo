## Why oo

- **Branches, not UUIDs.** Name an environment by its branch, any unique part of it, its name or
  its ID. Leave your personal branch prefix off.
- **One glance at everything.** The list shows what's running, when you last used each
  environment, its pull request, and any work that isn't on GitHub yet.
- **Knows what you mean.** `oo c` with no branch connects to the one running environment, or
  lets you pick from a list. Typos get a "did you mean".
- **A fresh environment in one command.** `oo new` creates an environment the way you did last
  time and connects you to it.
- **Doesn't make you wait.** Starting, stopping and deleting return straight away while Ona
  carries on in the background.
- **Quiet.** ona's own output stays behind a spinner with a timer. If something goes wrong, you
  see ona's error and any fixes it suggests.
- **Just a wrapper.** Everything goes through the `ona` and `gh` CLIs you already have set up.
  oo has no config file and stores nothing.

## Install

You'll need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and the [Ona CLI](https://ona.com/docs), logged in.
The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) is optional; with it, the list shows each branch's pull
request.

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/adamtrain/oo
```

That puts `oo` on your `PATH`. To hack on it, clone the repo and install it in editable mode, so
your changes take effect right away:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adamtrain/oo && cd oo
uv tool install --editable .
```

If your branches share a prefix, tell oo in your shell profile so you can leave it off:

```sh
export OO_BRANCH_PREFIX=adam/
```

For tab completion of branch names, run `oo --install-completion` once.

## Usage

```sh
oo                            # list your environments
oo c login-fix                # SSH into the one on adam/login-fix, starting it if needed
oo c                          # …the only running one, or pick from a list
oo c login -- git status      # run one command instead of opening a shell
oo open login -e cursor       # open it in Cursor (or set $OO_EDITOR)
oo new                        # create an environment and SSH into it
oo start login billing        # warm some up in the background
oo stop                       # stop the only running one (--all for every one)
oo rm old-spike               # delete one
ona env logs $(oo id login)   # hand an ID to any other ona command
```

### Naming an environment

Wherever oo asks for a branch, you can give:

1. An environment's ID or name
2. The full branch, like `adam/login-fix`, or the branch without `$OO_BRANCH_PREFIX`, like
   `login-fix`
3. The part after any other prefix, like `their-branch` for `sam/their-branch`
4. Any part of a branch or environment name, like `login`
5. The start or end of an ID

oo tries these in order and stops at the first that matches anything, so `login` means
`adam/login` even when `adam/login-fix` exists too. If a name still matches more than one
environment, oo lists them and asks which one you mean. In a script, with nobody to ask, it lists
them and stops instead.

When you have more than one environment on the same branch, lists also show when each was
created and the last 6 characters of its ID. Type those characters to name one directly, like
`oo c 0ffee1`.

### Reading the list

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Status** | `●` running · `◐` starting · `○` stopped. Running environments come first, then the rest by when you last used them. |
| **ID**, **Created** | Only when two environments share a branch: the end of each one's ID, and when it was created. |
| **Active** | When Ona last saw activity in the environment. |
| **PR** | The newest pull request from the branch: draft, open, approved, changes req., merged or closed. The number links to it. |
| **Changes** | Uncommitted files, and `unpushed` when the environment's latest commit isn't on GitHub. |

Ona updates git details while an environment runs, so a stopped environment shows how things
were when it stopped.

### Creating environments

`oo new` needs a project to create from and an environment class (a machine in a region) to run
on. Each defaults to whatever your newest environment used, so it usually does what you did last
time. To choose, use the options or set them in your shell profile:

| | Option | Variable | Takes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Project** | `-p, --project` | `OO_PROJECT` | An ID or name from `ona project list` |
| **Class** | `-c, --class` | `OO_CLASS` | An ID from `ona environment list-classes`, or words that pick one out, like `frankfurt` or `tokyo m7i` |

Class words prefer the classes the project offers, the same choices as Ona's region picker. Once
Ona has started the environment, oo connects to it. It starts on the project's default branch.

## Settings

| Variable | |
| --- | --- |
| `OO_BRANCH_PREFIX` | Your branch prefix, e.g. `adam/`. Dimmed in the list and optional when typing. |
| `OO_EDITOR` | Default editor for `oo open`: an alias from `ona environment list-editors`, like `cursor` |
| `OO_PROJECT` | Default project for `oo new` |
| `OO_CLASS` | Default environment class for `oo new` |

## How it works

oo reads your environments with `ona environment list --format json`, then passes the matching
ID to `ona environment ssh`, `open`, `start`, `stop` or `delete`. It runs these with their output
hidden behind a spinner, and if one fails, it shows the `Error:` and "Possible resolutions" ona
printed. `oo c` and `oo open` start a stopped environment that way first, then replace themselves
with the ona process, so SSH gets your terminal to itself.

Pull requests and push status come from a single GitHub GraphQL query per repository, made
through `gh api`. It asks for each branch's newest pull request and whether each environment's
latest commit exists on GitHub. If `gh` isn't installed, oo skips that column. If the query
fails, oo says so and lists everything else.

`oo new` notes which environments exist, runs `ona environment create`, and connects to the one
that wasn't there before.

## Development

```sh
uv sync                         # set up the environment
uv run pytest                   # run the tests
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .
uv run ty check                 # type-check
```

The tests fake both CLIs, so they run without Ona or GitHub.
